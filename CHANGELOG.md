## Beta

We’d love for you to join the public beta for the addition of the Flutter wrapper to our Video SDK. With this additional framework, you’re able to accelerate development of natively compiled, multi-platform, video-based applications from a single codebase, while building with Zoom’s core technology.

Please [share your feedback](https://zoom.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9GKCAz47kNTobB4?jfefe=new) before March 20, 2023. Thank you for being a Zoom tester!
